# File Token Counter ðŸ”¢

This project is a fork of [Ingenioeren/FileTokenCounter](https://github.com/Ingenioeren/FileTokenCounter).

## How is this different from the original?

- The original version counted tokens for a single file.
- This fork processes all supported files in a folder and exports a summary CSV.
